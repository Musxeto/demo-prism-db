# Microsoft SQL Server Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Schema Information Retrieval

We've fixed a critical issue with the schema retrieval for Microsoft SQL Server databases. The original implementation had problems with the SQL queries used to retrieve table information:

- **Issue**: Queries were not properly handling SQL Server's schema system.
- **Fix**: Updated the queries to include `TABLE_SCHEMA` in addition to `TABLE_NAME` to properly identify tables.

### 2. Key Changes Made

1. **Table Schema Handling**:
   - Added schema name handling throughout the code
   - Properly qualified table names with schema (e.g., `[schema].[table]`)
   - Default handling for the 'dbo' schema (the default SQL Server schema)

2. **SQL Query Improvements**:
   - Updated primary key queries to include schema information
   - Updated foreign key queries to correctly join tables on schema + name
   - Added error handling for sample row retrieval

3. **Connection Error Messages**:
   - Enhanced error messages to provide more helpful troubleshooting hints
   - Added specific guidance for ODBC driver installation

### 3. Testing Instructions

To test these fixes, please:

1. **Connection Testing**:
   - Create a new Microsoft SQL Server connection
   - Enter your SQL Server details (host, port 1433, database, username, password)
   - Verify that the connection test succeeds with version information

2. **Schema Browsing**:
   - After connecting, the schema browser should display all tables across all schemas
   - For tables in the 'dbo' schema, only the table name should be displayed
   - For tables in other schemas, they should be displayed as 'schema.table'

3. **Table Structure**:
   - Click on any table to view its structure
   - Verify that columns, primary keys, and foreign keys are correctly identified
   - Check that foreign key references display correctly

4. **Querying**:
   - Try simple queries like `SELECT * FROM [schema].[table]`
   - Verify that query results display correctly

## Notes

- The SQL Server integration requires a proper ODBC driver to be installed on the system
- Default port 1433 is used unless specified otherwise
- Make sure your SQL Server instance allows remote connections and SQL authentication
