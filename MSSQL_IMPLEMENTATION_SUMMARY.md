# Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the integration of Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) support into the database connection engine.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
- The backend already had MSSQL support via the `MSSQLConnector` class in `db_connectors.py` using `pyodbc`
- Added `pyodbc` to the `requirements.txt` file to ensure proper installation

### Frontend Changes
- Added MSSQL to the database type dropdown in the connection modal
- Set the default port to 1433 when MSSQL is selected
- Added UI support for displaying MSSQL connections

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Connect to MSSQL Database
- Launch the application
- Click "Add New Connection"
- Select "Microsoft SQL Server" from the Database Type dropdown
- Enter your MSSQL server details:
  - Host: your SQL Server hostname or IP
  - Port: 1433 (default)
  - Database: your database name
  - Username and Password: SQL Server authentication credentials

### 2. Test Schema Browser
- After connecting, check if tables and columns are properly displayed
- Verify that primary keys, foreign keys, and data types are correctly identified

### 3. Test Query Execution
- Try running simple SELECT queries
- Test more complex queries including JOINs
- Verify INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations work correctly

### 4. Verify Performance
- Test with larger tables/datasets
- Check execution time metrics

## Notes
- MSSQL connections use the default port 1433
- The implementation uses `pyodbc` which requires the appropriate SQL Server ODBC drivers to be installed on the server
- Supported ODBC drivers:
  - ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
  - ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
  - ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server
  - SQL Server Native Client 11.0
  - SQL Server Native Client 10.0
  - SQL Server
